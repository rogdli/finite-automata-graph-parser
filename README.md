A Node.js toolkit for parsing, processing, and converting finite automata from DOT graph files. Supports NFA/DFA operations including union, concatenation, Kleene closure, NFA-to-DFA conversion, and DFA minimization with automatic DOT file generation for visualization. 
Developed alongside Graphviz Online for testing and visualization.

Made for the Mandatory Assignment of the Theory of Computation course.
